# What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment can have a lot of causes.

1. Unwanted physical contact of any kind.
2. Staring or Leering
3. Passing lewd comments or cracking sexual jokes.
4. Demanding or expecting sexual favours for promotions, assignments, increments or any such things. Also known as quid pro quo harassment.
5. Gender based discrimination.
6. Showing sexually inappropriate visuals.
7. Commenting about one's body or looks in an unwelcoming fashion.
8. Any inappropriate signalling verbally, non-verbally, or physically.


# What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

If I face or witness any such issues, I'll follow protocol and try to find a solution through a step-by-step procedure.

1. Inform the executor that the behaviour is unwelcome and inappropriate. This might help set boundaries.
2. Document the incident and write details like date, time, location, activity and witnesses (if any).
3. On repeated actions, report to the concerned authorities with the details previously documented.
4. Register a complaint in writing.

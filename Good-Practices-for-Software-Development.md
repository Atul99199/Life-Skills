### Question 2:- Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

  **Ideas for improvement:**

  • Use a time-tracking tool like Boosted or RescueTime to measure and improve focused work hours.

  • Apply the Pomodoro technique with short, concentrated sessions followed by brief breaks.

  • Block distracting apps and websites during work using tools like Freedom or Cold Turkey.

  • Create a meal routine to avoid mid-day fatigue and low energy.

  • Include daily exercise to maintain higher energy levels and a better attention span.

# Learning Process
## What is the Feynman Technique?
The Feynman Technique is a powerful technique for explaining complex ideas in very simple terms.


## What was the most interesting story or idea for you?
The most interesting idea for me is:
Practice vs. Understanding

•&nbsp; Simply feeling comfortable with content (like re-reading) isn’t true understanding.

•&nbsp; Active recall is far more effective in forming deep, lasting knowledge.


## What are active and diffused modes of thinking?
### &nbsp; Focused Mode: 

This is when you concentrate deeply on a problem, paying close attention and working step by step.

### &nbsp; Diffuse Mode: 

This is a more relaxed state of mind, where your thoughts wander freely and new, creative ideas can appear.

## What are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? 
### When approaching a new topic we need to keep in mind these point:
1.&nbsp; Deconstruct the Skill

2.&nbsp; Learn Just Enough to Practice and Self-Correct

3.&nbsp; Remove Practice Barriers

4.&nbsp; Practice for at Least 20 Hours

## What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?
•&nbsp; Create a distraction-free environment by limiting social media and notifications.

•&nbsp; Use time-tracking apps to monitor productivity.

•&nbsp; Give complete attention to coding tasks.

•&nbsp; Explain concepts in your own simple terms.

•&nbsp; Implement ideas through exercises and projects.

•&nbsp; Set timelines to stay consistent.

•&nbsp; Keep learning enjoyable and stress-free.

•&nbsp; Develop expertise in a few core skills.

•&nbsp; Share updates and challenges clearly with others.

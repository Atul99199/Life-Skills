# Learning Process
## What is the Feynman Technique?
The Feynman Technique is a powerful technique for explaining complex ideas in very simple terms.


## What was the most interesting story or idea for you?
The most interesting idea for me is:
Practice vs. Understanding
•Simply feeling comfortable with content (like re-reading) isn’t true understanding.

•Active recall is far more effective in forming deep, lasting knowledge.


## What are active and diffused modes of thinking?
### Focused Mode: 
This is when you concentrate deeply on a problem, paying close attention and working step by step.
### Diffuse Mode: 
This is a more relaxed state of mind, where your thoughts wander freely and new, creative ideas can appear.

## What are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? 
### When approaching a new topic we need to keep in mind these point:
1.Deconstruct the Skill

2.Learn Just Enough to Practice and Self-Correct

3.Remove Practice Barriers

4.Practice for at Least 20 Hours

## What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?
•Create a distraction-free environment by limiting social media and notifications.

•Use time-tracking apps to monitor productivity.

•Give complete attention to coding tasks.

•Explain concepts in your own simple terms.

•Implement ideas through exercises and projects.

•Set timelines to stay consistent.

•Keep learning enjoyable and stress-free.

•Develop expertise in a few core skills.

•Share updates and challenges clearly with others.
